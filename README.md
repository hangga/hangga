- I've liked mathematics since junior high school and developed an interest in coding during my undergraduate studies in the Mathematics Department.
- My first programming languages were Matlab and Pascal, followed by C and C++.
- Iâ€™m currently working on **Java**, **Kotlin**, **Swift** & **Python**.
- "Sometimes, I also take on multiple roles in other programming languages. No problemâ€”it's fun!"
- Btw I use Arch for daily use.
